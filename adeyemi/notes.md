- ran prettier on all files (needed formatting)
- ran w3c html validator and fixed validation error (only one error (impressive) img alt attribute missing closing double quote)
- renamed stylesheet to correct spelling error in name
- renamed home.html to index.html
- all file names should be lowercased, changed one image file
- removed <img src="logo.png" alt="logo" class="logo" /> on registration
- very little time was spent on css and styling the site
- bootstrap not used at all
- in summary, great html, little effort on css and design
- project should represent 24-28 hours of work and I don't see that effort
