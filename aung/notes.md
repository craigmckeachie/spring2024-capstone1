## code formatting

- all pages needed prettier run on them
- excellent manual effort shown on code formatting but should have used tool prettier
- checkout prettier could not be run on due to validation issues
- css well formatted, ordered, proper use of bootstrap and one global stylesheet to override

## html validation

- all pages valid except checkout, missing closing head tag

## file naming and directory structure

### good

- all lowercase
- appropriate directory structure
