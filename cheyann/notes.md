- custom stylesheet needs to come after bootstrap stylesheet
- DOCTYPE needs to be the first thing in an html document, before a comment to pass html validation
- index w3c invalid, extra closing divs, extra section
- login.html invalid
  - DOCTYPE needs capitalized
  - html inputs need id that matches for attribute on label
  - closing footer tag contained an attribute that wasn't properly closed
- 7 checkout pages in project, unused should be deleted
- checkouttest.html should be renamed to checkout.html
- pages do not need page in their name that would be considered redundant
- products.html had several unclosed div tags

## Design

- no whitespace/margin on products page
- site title "Seven Pens" is not styled as a brand
- in general pages needed more common consistent styles
