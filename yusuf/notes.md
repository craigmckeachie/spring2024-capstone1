## Code Formatting

- all files needed prettier run on them although manual formatting was good
- stylesheets not in css folder
- no global stylesheet shared across all pages which creates duplicate styles and inconsistent look to the site
- image files have spaces in the names (which causes HTML validation issues)

## HTML Validation

- checkout.html invalid, small issue with heading being in head and not in body

  - index.html invalid
  - no body tag
  - content in head
  - stylesheet at bottom not in head
  - list items not in list (ul or ol)

- products.html invalid

  - space in image filename
  - a tag in head, should be in header not head, head is for non-visual elements (information)

- login.html invalid

  - visual content in head not in body
  - other validation issues

- userregistration.html invalid
  - similar issues to login page

## Code

- heavy use of <br>, should use css padding or margin to achieve instead

## Design

- needs more use of whitespace
- not consistent

## General
- code should represent 24-28 hours of work at a minimum and I don't see that effort in the work submitted
